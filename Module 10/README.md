Welcome to Module 10 of the Basic Malware Analysis Course. 

Your mission should you choose to accept it is to extract the configuration of all the samples of Revil Ransomware on https://bazaar.abuse.ch/.

There is a sample code for extraction of Revil configuration. You have to automate the downloading of all the samples from Bazaar Abuse, extract them from their zip files, extract the configuration from them and store them in a folder.

Bonus: for adding those details in the SQL Lite DB, with a table for the hash of the sample which points to the json of the configuration. 

Remove the unnessesary details like the ransom notes etc and keep only the IOC's that matter and that can protect us in the future.
